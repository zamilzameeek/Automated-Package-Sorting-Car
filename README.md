## Project Overview
The Automated Package Sorting Car project aims to design and implement a car capable of detecting small boxes of different colors and directing them to their respective finish lines. This system streamlines the sorting process by utilizing color detection technology integrated with an Arduino-based control system to efficiently sort packages based on their color.

## Aim
The goal of this project is to create a functional automated vehicle that can accurately detect and sort packages by color, enhancing the efficiency of sorting operations in various applications such as logistics and warehouse management.

## Materials Used
- **Arduino Uno microcontroller**
- **Color sensor module**
- **Car chassis and wheels**
- **DC motors/Servo motor and motor driver**
- **Battery pack**
- **Various colored boxes**
- **Reflective surfaces or markers for start and finish lines**

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The system initializes by setting up the Arduino microcontroller and configuring the color sensor module.
   
2. **Start Line Detection**: The car begins at a designated start line and waits for packages to be placed on the sorting platform.
   
3. **Package Detection and Color Recognition**: When a package is placed on the sorting platform, the color sensor module detects the color of the package.
   
4. **Sorting Decision**: The Arduino microcontroller processes the color information and determines the appropriate direction (left, right, or straight) for the car to move based on predefined color-to-direction mappings.
   
5. **Car Movement**: The car moves forward towards its designated finish line according to the sorting decision made by the microcontroller. It navigates using the DC motors controlled by the motor driver module.
   
6. **Package Delivery**: Upon reaching the appropriate finish line, the car stops and deposits the sorted package before returning to the start line for the next sorting cycle.
   
7. **Feedback**: The system can provide feedback, such as LED indicators or LCD display output, indicating the sorting decision and status.

### Hardware Setup

1. **Assemble the Car Chassis**: Attach the wheels and DC motors to the car chassis.
2. **Connect the Motors**: Connect the DC motors to the motor driver module.
3. **Mount the Color Sensor**: Secure the color sensor module on the car, ensuring it can detect the color of packages placed on the sorting platform.
4. **Wire the Components**: Connect the Arduino Uno to the motor driver, color sensor, and power supply.
5. **Prepare the Sorting Platform**: Set up the start and finish lines with reflective surfaces or markers for accurate detection.

### Software Setup
1. **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries for the color sensor and motor driver.
3. **Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno to control the carâ€™s movement and sorting logic.

## Conclusion
This automated package sorting car offers a scalable and efficient solution for sorting packages based on color. By leveraging Arduino microcontroller technology and color detection capabilities, the system provides a versatile platform for various sorting applications, including logistics, warehouse management, and educational demonstrations.
